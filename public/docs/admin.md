   - Marks jobs as completed or failed
   - Logs execution results

### Setting Up CRON Jobs

#### Method 1: Using Vercel Cron Jobs (Recommended for Vercel Deployments)

Vercel provides built-in CRON job functionality through `vercel.json`. However, **Vercel plan limits apply**:

- **Hobby Plan**: 2 CRON jobs maximum
- **Pro Plan**: 2 CRON jobs maximum
- **Enterprise Plan**: Unlimited CRON jobs

**Configuration** (`vercel.json`):

```json
{
	"crons": [
		{
			"path": "/api/cron/execute",
			"schedule": "0 0 * * *"
		}
	]
}
```

**CRON Schedule Examples**:

- `0 0 * * *` - Every day at midnight (00:00 UTC)
- `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours
- `0 9 * * 1` - Every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC
- `*/15 * * * *` - Every 15 minutes
- `0 0 1 * *` - First day of every month at midnight
- `0 0 * * 0` - Every Sunday at midnight
- `0 12 * * *` - Every day at noon (12:00 UTC)
- `0 0,12 * * *` - Twice daily at midnight and noon

**CRON Expression Format**:

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

#### Method 2: Using External CRON Services

If you've reached your Vercel CRON job limit or want more flexibility, use external services:

**Popular Options**:

1. **Cron-job.org** (Free tier available)
   - Schedule: `https://your-domain.com/api/cron/execute`
   - Method: POST
   - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET_TOKEN`

2. **EasyCron** (Free tier available)
   - Similar setup to Cron-job.org

3. **GitHub Actions** (Free for public repos)
   - Create `.github/workflows/cron.yml`:

   ```yaml
   name: Execute CRON Jobs
   on:
     schedule:
       - cron: "0 0 * * *" # Daily at midnight UTC
   jobs:
     execute:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Call CRON endpoint
           run: |
             curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/execute \
               -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET_TOKEN }}"
   ```

4. **Uptime Robot** (Free tier: 50 monitors)
   - Can be configured to ping your endpoint periodically

#### Method 3: Manual Execution

You can manually trigger CRON job execution:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET_TOKEN"

# Using GET (for testing, if no auth token set)
curl https://your-domain.com/api/cron/execute
```

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variable for security:

```env
CRON_SECRET_TOKEN=your-secret-token-here
```

**Security Note**: Always set `CRON_SECRET_TOKEN` in production to prevent unauthorized access to your CRON endpoint.

### How CRON Jobs Work

1. **Scheduling**: When you schedule a blog post or email in the admin panel, a CRON job is created in Firestore
2. **Execution**: The `/api/cron/execute` endpoint is called at the scheduled time (via Vercel Cron or external service)
3. **Processing**: The endpoint:
   - Fetches all scheduled CRON jobs from Firestore
   - Filters jobs that are due (scheduled date <= current time)
   - Executes each job:
     - **Blog jobs**: Publishes the blog post
     - **Email jobs**: Sends email to all active subscribers
   - Updates job status (completed/failed)
4. **Result**: Jobs are marked as completed or failed with error messages

### CRON Job Statuses

- **scheduled**: Job is waiting to be executed
- **completed**: Job executed successfully
- **failed**: Job execution failed (check error message)
- **cancelled**: Job was manually cancelled

### Troubleshooting

**CRON jobs not executing**:

1. Check if the endpoint is being called (check Vercel logs or external service logs)
2. Verify `CRON_SECRET_TOKEN` is set correctly if using authentication
3. Check Firestore for scheduled jobs with status "scheduled"
4. Verify the scheduled date is in the past or current time
5. Check Vercel function logs for errors

**Vercel CRON limit reached**:

- Remove unused CRON jobs from `vercel.json` or Vercel dashboard
- Use external CRON service as alternative
- Upgrade Vercel plan for more CRON jobs

**Jobs failing**:

- Check job error messages in the CRON Jobs tab
- Verify blog/email data is complete
- Check email service (Resend) configuration
- Verify subscriber list is not empty for email jobs

```javascript
import { exportData } from "@/lib/api/export";

// Export blogs to CSV
await exportData("csv", "blogs", blogs, { filename: "my-blogs.csv" });

// Export to JSON
await exportData("json", "blogs", blogs, {
	filename: "my-blogs.json",
	pretty: true,
});

// Export to PDF
await exportData("pdf", "blogs", blogs, { filename: "my-blogs.pdf" });

// Export to Excel
await exportData("excel", "blogs", blogs, { filename: "my-blogs.xlsx" });
```

### Export Features

**Data Processing**:

- **Timestamp Conversion**: Firestore timestamps automatically converted to readable dates
- **HTML Stripping**: HTML content in fields like "content" or "body" is stripped for CSV/Excel
- **Content Truncation**: Long content fields are truncated (500 chars for CSV, 1000 for Excel)
- **Object Flattening**: Nested objects are flattened with dot notation (e.g., `user.name`)
- **Array Handling**: Arrays are converted to semicolon-separated strings

**Field Mappings**:

Each data type has predefined field mappings that provide user-friendly column headers:

- `id` → "ID"
- `createdAt` → "Created At"
- `email` → "Email"
- etc.

**Error Handling**:

- Validates data before export
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Handles missing dependencies gracefully (e.g., xlsx package for Excel)
- Provides loading states during export

### Best Practices

1. **Filter Before Export**: Use search and filters to export only relevant data
2. **Large Datasets**: For very large datasets, consider filtering to reduce export size
3. **Excel Format**: Use Excel format for data that needs further analysis or formulas
4. **JSON Format**: Use JSON for data migration or API integration
5. **PDF Format**: Use PDF for reports or documentation that needs to be shared
6. **CSV Format**: Use CSV for simple spreadsheet imports

### Troubleshooting

**Excel export not working**:

- Ensure `xlsx` package is installed: `npm install xlsx`
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify data is not empty

**PDF export issues**:

- Large datasets may take time to generate
- Check browser console for jsPDF errors
- Ensure data contains valid content

**Date formatting issues**:

- Dates are automatically converted from Firestore timestamps
- If dates appear incorrect, check Firestore data structure
- ISO format used for JSON exports

1. **Code Splitting**: Lazy load admin components
2. **Caching**: React Query caching
3. **Pagination**: Large lists paginated
4. **Debouncing**: Search input debounced
5. **Memoization**: Expensive computations memoized

## Error Handling

### Error States

- Network errors
- Validation errors
- Permission errors
- Not found errors

### Error Display

- Toast notifications
- Error messages
- Retry options
- Fallback UI

## Best Practices

1. **Permissions**: Always check before actions
2. **Validation**: Validate inputs
3. **Feedback**: Show loading/success states
4. **Confirmation**: Confirm destructive actions
5. **Error Handling**: Handle all errors gracefully
6. **Performance**: Optimize queries and renders
7. **Accessibility**: Use semantic HTML and ARIA

## Customization

### Adding New Tabs

1. Create component in `app/admin/components/`
2. Add route in `app/admin/index.jsx`
3. Add navigation item
4. Configure permissions

### Customizing Styles

- Tailwind CSS classes
- Custom components
- Theme configuration
- Responsive breakpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Role not updating**: Clear cache, refresh
2. **Permissions denied**: Check role in teams collection
3. **Data not loading**: Check Firebase config
4. **Editor not working**: Check Tiptap dependencies

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```javascript
console.log("User role:", userRole);
console.log("Permissions:", permissions);
```

## Environment Variables

```env
# Required for admin panel
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
# ... other Firebase vars
```
